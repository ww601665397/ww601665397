Dynamic assessment of lung injury by ultrasound in patients with acute paraquat poisoning

Abstract
Objective: To investigate the value of ultrasound in the dynamic assessment of lung injury after
acute paraquat poisoning.
Methods: A prospective observational study was performed on patients with paraquat poisoning
from admission to day 28 or discharge. Ultrasound assessment of the lungs was performtyed
every 48 hours. The correlation of the lung ultrasound score (LUS) with other indicators was
analyzed.
Results: Twenty-six patients were enrolled, with an average age of 46 16 years. The average
toxic dose was 95 51 mL. The intensive care unit (ICU) stay averaged 9 8 days, and the 28-day
mortality was 88.5%. There was a significant negative correlation between LUS and oxygenation
index (rho ¼ 0.896) and a significant positive correlation between LUS and carbon dioxide concentration (rho ¼ 0.567). Lung ultrasound and computed tomography imaging correlated closely.
Conclusion: Lung ultrasound can reflect changes in lung status in patients with paraquat poisoning and can be used to evaluate lung injury in these patients.
